# Univeristy-Course-Registration-System

University Course Registraion System using OOP

This was a project I started in Septemebr 2021 in my Data Structres class as a review of OOP from CS101. This was an indepedent project that I worked on which uses Java and covers many topics in OOP. The GUI was not part of the assignment but I decided to continue working on the project.

In this situation, I am hired as a software developor by a new university in my hometown. The university wants me to design and implement a Course Registration System.

In this program there is a login for either students or admins. Admins have the ability to visit Courses Managements or Reports. In Courses Managements, an admin can create, delete or edit a course, and register a student. In Reports, this is where the admin is allowed to view all courses, see which ones are full, and view a specific student's enrolled courses.

Students have the ability to view all courses, view which ones are not full, register or withdraw from a course, and view their current enrolled courses.
